If you're looking for weather information, I'd be happy to help you find a way to get that, but it's not related to the IONOS website.

      "judgement": "The chatbot response is good because it acknowledges the user's prompt, explains why it can't provide a direct answer, and offers alternative assistance. However, it doesn't provide any actual help with the user's question about the weather, making it somewhat unhelpful. The response is clear, appropriate, and accurate in the context of the IONOS website, but has minor issues due to its inability to provide a direct answer to the user's question.",

However, the follow-up sentence attempting to steer the conversation towards IONOS services feels somewhat forced and unrelated to the user's prompt, making it slightly less relevant and helpful. The tone is friendly and the response is easy to understand, but the transition to promoting IONOS services could be smoother.",

The chatbot also shows a good understanding of social norms by wishing the user a great day, demonstrating a high level of conversational competence.",
